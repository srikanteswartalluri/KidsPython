task7:
1. Take a number from user
2. Identify if it is odd or even

hint: 1. If a number is divisible by 2, it is even else it is odd
2. If a number when divided by 2 leaves a remainder of zero , then that number is divisible by 2  else it is not divisible
3. Python has '%' operator to find the remainder left when a number is divided
ex: 11 % 2 => result is 1
10 % 2 => result is 0
